# Minilibc
Overview

Minilibc is a lightweight C library that aims to recreate essential string and memory manipulation functions from the standard C library in assembly. This project focuses on implementing the following functions in assembly language:

    strlen :white_check_mark:
    strchr :white_check_mark:
    memset :white_check_mark:
    strcmp :white_check_mark:
    memmove
    strncmp :white_check_mark:
    strcasecmp
    rindex
    strstr
    strpbrk
    strcspn

# TODO
- implement unity
- implement lodsb
- add release library
- add folder for asm build
- think of an automatic system with makefile
- fix strcmp
